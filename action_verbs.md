# Action Verbs
When listing your past experience, it's more effective to use action verbs to describe your accomplishments (try adding some [strong adverbs](https://www.standout-cv.com/usa/resume-adverbs) for emphasis). 

For example, instead of:
"Responsible for handling a high volume of inbound customer requests per day"

Try:
"Successfully managed 50-70 inbound customer requests per day, consistently ranking in the top 5% of all support associates"

Here's a starting list of some examples you can use to make your resume stand out.
